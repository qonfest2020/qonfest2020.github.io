											<b>On Privacy and Accuracy in Data Releases</b>
											<br><br>
											<b>Abstract</b> In this talk we study the relationship between privacy and accuracy in the context of correlated datasets. We use a model of quantitative information flow to describe the the trade-off between privacy of individuals’ data and and the utility of queries to that data by modelling the effectiveness of adversaries attempting to make inferences after a data release. We show that, where correlations exist in datasets, it is not possible to implement optimal noise-adding mechanisms that give the best possible accuracy or the best possible privacy in all situations. Finally we illustrate the trade-off between accuracy and privacy for local and oblivious differentially private mechanisms in terms of inference attacks on medium-scale datasets.

											<b>A Survey of Bidding Games on Graphs</b>
											<br><br>
											<b>Abstract</b> A graph game is a two-player zero-sum game in which the players move a token throughout a graph to produce an infinite path, which determines the winner or payoff of the game. In bidding games, both players have budgets, and in each turn, we hold an “auction” (bidding) to determine which player moves the token. In this survey, we consider several bidding mechanisms and study their effect on the properties of the game. Specifically, bidding games, and in particular bidding games of infinite duration, have an intriguing equivalence with random-turn games in which in each turn, the player who moves is chosen randomly. We show how minor changes in the bidding mechanism lead to unexpected differences in the equivalence with random-turn games.

											<b>Applying Formal Methods in Industrial Railway Applications at Thales</b>
											<br><br>
											<b>Abstract</b> This talk provides an overview of various applications of formal methods at Thales in the context of ground transportation and presents one of the use cases in detail. For each of the presented methods the motivation and corresponding fields of application are discussed. The use case at focus of this talk is the application of a formal method for extending the set of supported redundancy architectures of the TAS Control Platform. It is shown how property-driven design and TLA+ have been used in this context to increase the confidence in the design and implementation and how the overall approach has been integrated in the development process in accordance with the international railway safety standard CENELEC EN 50128.
											<br><br>
											<b>Short Bio: </b>
											Stefan Resch is system architect at Thales in Vienna. He received his PhD degree in Computer Science from the Vienna University of Technology in 2015 on composability for fail-safe systems. Currently, he is working as system architect for the TAS Control Platform, a safety-critical fault-tolerant computing platform for railway control applications which is used in 80% of Thales' safety critical solutions for ground transportation. His main focus are novel safety mechanisms and distributed algorithms for safety-critical systems in the railway domain.

											<b>Safe Reinforcement Learning using Probabilistic Shields</b>
											<br><br>
											<b>Abstract</b> This paper concerns the efficient construction of a safety shield for reinforcement learning. We specifically target scenarios that incorporate uncertainty and use Markov decision processes (MDPs) as the underlying model to capture such problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that can determine near-optimal policies in MDPs that may be unknown before exploring the model. However, during exploration, RL is prone to induce behavior that is undesirable or not allowed in safety- or mission-critical contexts. We introduce the concept of a probabilistic shield that enables RL decision-making to adhere to safety constraints with high probability. We employ formal verification to efficiently compute the probabilities of critical decisions within a safety-relevant fragment of the MDP. These results help to realize a shield that, when applied to an RL algorithm, restricts the agent from taking unsafe actions, while optimizing the performance objective. We discuss tradeoffs between sufficient progress in the exploration of the environment and ensuring safety. In our experiments, we demonstrate on the arcade game PAC-MAN and on a case study involving service robots that the learning efficiency increases as the learning needs orders of magnitude fewer episodes.

											<b>Machine Learning for Reliability Analysis of Large Scale Distributed Systems</b>
											<br><br>
											<b>Abstract</b> As distributed systems dramatically grow in terms of scale, complexity, and usage, understanding the hidden interactions among system and workload properties becomes an exceedingly difficult task. Machine learning models for prediction of system behavior (and analysis) are increasingly popular but their effectiveness in answering what and why is not always the most favorable. In this talk I will present two reliability analysis studies from two large, distributed systems: one that looks into GPGPU error prediction at the Titan, a large scale high-performance-computing system at ORNL, and one that analyzes the failure characteristics of solid state drives at a Google data center and hard disk drives at the Backblaze data center. Both studies illustrate the difficulty of untangling complex interactions of workload characteristics that lead to failures and of identifying failure root causes from monitored symptoms. Nevertheless, this difficulty can occasionally manifest in spectacular results where failure prediction can be dramatically accurate.

											<b>Modern Applications of Game-Theoretic Principles</b>
											<br><br>
											<b>Abstract</b> Game theory is the study of the strategic behavior of rational decision makers who are aware that their decisions affect one another. Its simple but universal principles have found applications in the most diverse disciplines, including economics, social sciences, evolutionary biology, as well as logic, system science and computer science. Despite its long-standing tradition and its many advances, game theory is still a young and developing science. In this paper, we describe some recent and exciting applications in the fields of machine learning and privacy.

											team at the Inria Saclay - Île-de-France research center, which is studying privacy, security, and how information circulates 
											on social network and the risks related to that.
											Her research has led to the production of different tools like Location Guard, an obfuscation mechanism that takes the form of 
											a browser extension and helps protect user locations. 
											Her work led to numerous academic and industrial collaborations and has recently been awarded with an ERC Advanced Grant 2019.
